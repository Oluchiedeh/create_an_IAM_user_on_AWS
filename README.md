# create_an_IAM_user_on_AWS

**WHO IS AN IAM USER?** - an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user is an entity that you create to represent an individual person or application that interacts with AWS resources. IAM users are part of AWSâ€™s access management system and can be assigned permissions to access and manage AWS services and resources.

**Let's create Adminstrator as an IAM user.**

- Start with creating a AWS Account
- From the log in page, sign in as the root user with password.
- Then proceed to the IAM console.
